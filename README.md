# Graph Analytics â€” EDBT Summer School 2025

This repository contains the slide deck presented by Charalampos E. Tsourakakis at the EDBT Summer School, held in Nicosia on July 8, 2025. 
The lecture explores algorithmic and machine learning techniques in modern graph analytics, focusing on both foundational theory and scalable practice.

## Highlights

- Graph models and key metrics (density, conductance, arboricity etc)
- Triangle counting algorithms: exact, approximate
- Spectral methods and graph sparsification
- Densest subgraph detection: Goldbergâ€™s min-cut, Charikarâ€™s greedy, Greedy++
- Triangle densest subgraphs and k-clique generalizations
- Motif-aware graph clustering 
- Unsupervised node embeddings
